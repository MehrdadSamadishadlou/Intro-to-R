# Introduction to R: From Data to Discovery

A compact, interactive **4-hour workshop** for beginners to gain hands-on experience using R for data analysis and visualization. Participants will learn to navigate RStudio, understand R’s logic, explore and visualize data, and create shareable, reproducible reports.

**Who is it for?** Anyone curious about data—students, researchers, or professionals from any field.

**Goal:** Leave with the confidence to start exploring and communicating data using R.

---

## 1) Get Ready: Installing R and RStudio

We begin by setting up the R environment and RStudio interface—the tools you’ll use for all your work in R. You’ll learn how to install both, configure your workspace, and understand where to write, run, and save your code.

---

## 2) Speak R: Console Basics and Syntax

This section introduces the “language” of R—how it reads and interprets instructions. You’ll learn how R handles numbers, text, and simple commands, and how to interact with the console to test ideas quickly. You’ll see how functions work and how R gives feedback when something goes wrong.

---

## 3) Know Your Data: Types and Structures

Here we’ll uncover how R organizes information. You’ll learn about R’s main data structures—vectors, data frames, and lists—and why each matters. Understanding these forms helps you manipulate and analyze data efficiently.


---

## 4) Tame Your Data: Importing, Cleaning, and Wrangling

This session focuses on one of the most essential skills in data science—preparing messy data for analysis. You’ll learn how to import data files, handle missing values, and reshape datasets into useful formats. We’ll discuss best practices for naming, consistency, and reproducibility.



---

## 5) See the Story: Data Exploration and Visualization

Now we turn numbers into insights. You’ll discover how to visualize relationships, patterns, and trends using R’s ggplot. We’ll explore how color, shape, and layout affect interpretation and how visualization can tell a story about your data.

---

## 6) Share Your Work: Reports with R Markdown

The final section demonstrates how to turn analysis into communication. With R Markdown, you can combine text, code, and visuals into one reproducible report. It ensures your results are transparent and easy to share.

**Outcome:** A polished, self-contained document that integrates your analysis and results. Participants will leave knowing how to produce clean HTML or PDF reports suitable for presentations, assignments, or publications.

---

## What You’ll Walk Away With

* A working R environment on your own laptop.
* An understanding of R’s basic language and structure.
* Experience cleaning, exploring, and visualizing real data.
* A reproducible report demonstrating your new skills.

---

## Logistics

* **Duration:** 3 hours (single session)
* **Format:** Live demo + guided hands-on exercises
* **Prereqs:** None—just curiosity!
* **Materials:** Sample datasets, exercise scripts, and slides provided

**Questions or ready to register?** → Open an issue or contact the organizer via the GitHub repository.
